1. ontology - OBO

2. algorithms

3. annotated data

# Minutes #
due to audio setup problems, meeting starts 10:30EST

1. ontology
> ontology submitted to OBO

**ACTION ITEM**: michel to figure out how to get CHEMINF redirection from OBO library purl

> not OBO foundry until larger community

**ACTION ITEM**: submit to NCBO bioportal

> leo: do we have proper coverage of CDK, OpenBabel?

**ACTION ITEM**: leo to confirm CDK & OpenBabel coverage.

> egon: CDK descriptors are in
> > http://qsar.svn.sf.net/viewvc/qsar/trunk/qsar-dicts/descriptor-implementations.owl?revision=213&view=markup

**ACTION ITEM**: egon to find one descriptor that fits into multiple categories


> egon: atomic/bond/molecular descriptors
> michel: these are automatically categorized due to 'aboutness' relation

> egon: QSAR community uses 0D,1D,2D,3D,4D,5D descriptors, how does this play?
**ACTION ITEM**: egon to give some examples for next call

> leo: suggests to find a list, if such a list exists

> michel: think about categorization for leaf nodes directly under "chemical descriptor" - would be nice to have additional info.

**ACTION ITEM**: ALL to think about this.

> egon: add electronic descriptor
> egon: add topological descriptor
> egon: add geometric descriptor

2. algorithms
> janna: need to be clear between descriptor and algorithm
> leo: the algorithm/implementation not specific

**ACTION ITEM**: egon to create N3 file of algorithms linking to descriptors

> janna: need to get list of implementations (CDK/OpenBabel/OEChem/Daylight/MOE/JOELIB/cinfony)

> egon: cinfony uses particular parameters, or process to derive descriptor values

> egon: BODO has "is modification of"/"derived from" -> how to include in CHEMINF
> michel: defined class

3. annotated data
> janna: need reasonable size subset
> egon: calculate a number of descriptors for

4. Egon's acs - rdf meeting -> should we put together a paper?
> end of march.
> janna: having triple store & asking questions.
> leo: link sadi services with calculation of CHEMINF properties is really what we should strive for.
