Egon, Leo, Michel

# Agenda #

1. ACS RDF meeting abstract discussion.
2. Ensuring complete coverage of descriptor classes used by major cheminformatics software vendors.
3. RDFization of chemical samples provided by Janna: setting up repositories. Points of inherent data integrability due to use of cheminf.
4. Proof of principle: populating descriptor classes with descriptor instances, integrating with algorithm specifications - CDK.
5. Ontology modularity.

# Minutes #
1. ACS RDF meeting abstract
> -> finalize (add affiliations), distribute for last comments and submit.
> -> some talk of SADI

2. Coverage of descriptor classes by major cheminformatics software
> -> looked at CDK, RDkit, will look at one of the others listed on wiki page.
> -> ask Nico whether he wants to contribute to MOE descriptors
> -> Leo to consolidate descriptors, and add them all at once.

3. RDFization of chemical samples, integration of descriptors computed through different sources
> -> Leo has sent Egon a sample of data; Egon calculating some 20 descriptors to add; Leo will add topological features / geometry, functional groups
> -> canonical SMILES (only available in one toolkit) vs canonical InCHI (two versions)
> -> to use standard InCHI generated by OpenBabel.
> -> use descriptor voc from cheminf + integrate
